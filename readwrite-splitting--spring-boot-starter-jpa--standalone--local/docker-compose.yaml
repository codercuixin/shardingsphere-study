# This line tells Docker Compose the version we're using
version: "3"

# Here's where we define our services:
services:
  # The master server, the OG in this world
  mysql-master:
    # We'll use the latest MySQL image from Docker Hub
    image: mysql:8.4.3
    # Give it a cool name (mysql-master is pretty clear, right?)
    container_name: mysql-master
    # Extra commands to configure the master for replication
    command: --server-id=1 --log-bin=mysql-bin --binlog-format=row
    # Set some environment variables for passwords and database details
    # Remember to replace these with your own strong passwords!
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 123456
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase # Feel free to change this database name
      MYSQL_USER: replication_user # This user will handle replication
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: replication_password
    # Map the container port (3306) to your host machine's port (also 3306)
    # This lets you access the master server from your machine
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
  # The replica server, the master's trusty sidekick
  mysql-slave:
    # Same image as the master
    image: mysql:8.4.3
    # Another cool name (can you guess what it is?)
    container_name: mysql-slave
    # This tells the replica to wait for the master to be ready before starting
    depends_on:
      - mysql-master
    # Similar commands and environment variables as the master
    command: --server-id=2 --log-bin=mysql-bin --binlog-format=row
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 123456 # Same password for both
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      MYSQL_USER: replication_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: replication_password
    # Map the container port (3306) to a different host machine port (3307 in this case)
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"
